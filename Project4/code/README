Directions for use:
   In src/main.C:
      set DataDirectory to the absolute path to the event files
      set EventFile to the absolute path to the event file list (this should already be in the src directory)
      uncomment task you would like to do
      set sample_cluster to the filename prefix to which you would like to save plots/metric spaces
   
   In src/eventfiles.dat:
      uncomment event files over which you would like to run ( "#" is the comment symbol )
   
   In "code" directory:
      type "make"
      run ./TopoJets
         -This will make .csv files with the distances b/w each of the points in the point clouds
      open Matlab
      run init.m to load TDATools
      open diagram.m and change dir_name to the absolute pathto the .csv files made with ./TopoJets (make sure these are the only files in that directory)
      run diagram.m to make persistence diagrams of the .csv metric spaces that were made with ./TopoJets

Requirements:
   Root version 5.xx
   Matlab version 9
